# Sigmoid function in C
A simple implementation of the Sigmoid function in C that can be used for ANN.

To use this sigmoid function in C, clone this repository then add the required files to your build path. Or, as there is no license, you can also just copy and paste the sigmoid function and the needed Euler constant defined in the src/sigmoid.h file.
